Just to play around with docker

The goal of this project is to create a web server that updates itselves whenever a file has been changed.

The idea is to eliminate the manual steps required in the traditional workflow.

Note: the project depends on Gorilla, but I'll probably remove this dependency by my own functions a.s.a.p.
